<b>tp-design-patterns</b>
This project is a Java application that showcases the implementation of various design patterns to manage different scenarios efficiently.

<ul>
<li>Builder Pattern:</li>

The project demonstrates the Builder pattern by implementing an object builder (Applicant, ApplicationFile) responsible for constructing objects step by step.

<li>Factory Pattern:</li>

The project employs the Factory pattern to create different types of objects.

<li>Chain of Responsibility Pattern:</li>

The project showcases the Chain of Responsibility pattern to process a ShoppingOrder with different status values for each step, in a flexible and decoupled manner. There's a ShoppingOrder class, and multiple handler classes that can process the order. Each handler has a reference to the next handler in the chain, allowing orders to be passed along the chain until one of the handlers handles it.

<li>Strategy Pattern:</li>

The project utilizes the Strategy pattern to implement different ways to compute a product's taxed price. Clients can choose which computing strategy to use at runtime by setting the appropriate product category and the appropriate strategy.

The DesignPatternsDemo project provides a practical demonstration of these design patterns, illustrating their benefits in terms of flexibility, maintainability, and reusability in software development.
