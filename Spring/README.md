<b>consuming-rest-service</b> : following the guide https://spring.io/guides/gs/consuming-rest

<b>N.B with some changes : </b>
<ol>
  <li>I used this REST API as a data provider (instead of the example given in the guide, "quotes") : https://restful-api.dev/ </li>
  <li>I tried to create an enhanced solution using some tips like : java reflection, json parsing, unit testing, dependency injection and some of the clean code tips</li>
</ol>

<b>The code may not be 100% clean, but i'm pretty sure it is clean enough. In case, feel free to comment or to leave me messages with your feedback. It will be so helpful</b>
