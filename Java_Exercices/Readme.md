  <b>fizzbuzz-generator</b>
  
  Java project presenting an advanced solution for the fizzbuzz problem.
  
  The used solution is more generic because it can replace a number by a custom sequence (if you don't want to use "fizz" and "buzz" words)
  
  <b>N.B:</b> There is no main function but you can run the example from the unit tests.
