  <b>fizzbuzz-generator</b>
  
  Java project presenting an advanced solution for the fizzbuzz problem.
  
  The used solution is more generic because it can replace a number by a custom sequence (if you don't want to use "fizz" and "buzz" words)
  
  <b>N.B:</b> There is no main function but you can run the example from the unit tests.

  <b>tdd-clean-code</b>
  
  Java project presenting some simple java exercices : 
    <ol>
      <li>Addition of two numbers (with unit tests)</li>
      <li>Birthday check : program that checks if a provided date (from system or in-memory or fixed value) is equal to an input birthday date (normally user input).</li>
      <li>Palindrom check : program that checks if a given string is a palindrome (can be read from left to right and vice-versa)</li>
    </ol>
    
  <b>N.B:</b> 
  Each program is included in its own package and in each package there is a simple XXXXXXMain class to test the code.
  <br>
  In addition, for each program there is a set of unit tests using some good practices and techniques for simple java code testing.
