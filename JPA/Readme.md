  <b>java-persistence-showcase</b>
  
  The "java-persistence-showcase" project is a demonstration of Java Persistence API (JPA) usage, showcasing various types of entity relationships and repository patterns. 
  
  The project includes code examples illustrating one-to-one and one-to-many relationships, both unidirectional and bidirectional. 
  
  It features repository classes responsible for CRUD operations on entities and main classes demonstrating how these relationships are established and managed in a Java application. 
  
  Dive into this showcase to explore practical implementations of JPA relationships and repository patterns, and gain insights into effective data persistence strategies in Java applications.
  
  <b>Used relations</b> :

  <ul>
    <li>One to one : uni and bi directionnal example</li>
    <li>One to many (and one to one) : uni and bi directionnal example</li>
  </ul>

  In every package, you can find the entities, the repository class and a XXXXMain class to test the given examples.
  
  <b>N.B</b> This project is configured to run with H2 in-memory database, for testing purposes (see src/main/resources/persistence.xml)
